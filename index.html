        description="Took this after an exam, remembering that while I did not know the answer to the last question, I do know love, I know friendship, I know-"
        alttext="The image captures an urban evening scene at dusk. Several modern buildings, including both residential and commercial structures, line the street. The buildings are partially lit, with warm lights visible in many windows, contrasting against the dimming sky. A vibrant sunset in shades of yellow and blue hues fills the sky behind the buildings. In the foreground, cars with headlights turned on are either parked or moving slowly along a wet street, reflecting the lights on the surface. A stop sign is also visible on the right side, adding to the urban street scene."

        alttext="The image is an aerial nighttime view of a T-shaped intersection in an urban area. The scene is illuminated by streetlights and vehicle headlights, with a multistory parking garage on the left and a two-story building with lit storefronts on the right corner. A few cars are visible on the roads, either moving or stopped at traffic lights. The streets are wet, reflecting the lights, which adds to the nighttime ambiance of the setting. Visible street markings include crosswalks and stop lines at the intersection."

        This picture was taken at the parking lot after I finished a rough exam. Sometimes an aerial view is needed to remind you how small the world really is.

        alttext="The image shows a close-up of a plush toy resembling Totoro from the animated movie "My Neighbor Totoro." The toy is crocheted in shades of grey and white, depicting Totoro with a sleepy expression. Its ears are perked up, and it features the character's distinctive face with closed eyes and a wide, toothless smile. The plush is being held against the backdrop of a city street, indicating the photo was likely taken outdoors during the day."

        Technically this picture was taken in State College, so it is relevant.
